# Group-10--EAS-509-Time-series-Forecasts-for-tourism-in-the-UK

Travelling has become everyoneâ€™s go to in order to get relief from work stress. The number of people visiting Thailand has increased day to day. Thailand has many tourist attractions where number of people visiting these places has increased and the services which are provided by the travel industry has become inadequate. So, in order to keep track of the demand in this project we have done time series analysis on the number of people visiting Thailand from other countries over a period of time from 2010-2016.
